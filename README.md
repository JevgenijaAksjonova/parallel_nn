# A study of parallel feed forward neural networks

In this project, parallelization is used to boost the time performance of a fully-connected feed forward neural network solving a handwritten digit recognition problem using the MNIST dataset. Two implementations of the algorithm are presented: a MPI implementation, which is executed on several CPU cores across multiple processors, and a GPU-based implementation, using the CUDA C library.
